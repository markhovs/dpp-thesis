 abstract = {The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is a concept of a policy instrument particularly pushed by policy circles to contribute to a circular economy. The preliminary design of the DPP is supposed to have product-related information compiled mainly by manufactures and, thus, to provide the basis for more circular products. Given the lack of scientific debate on the DPP, this study seeks to work out design options of the DPP and how these options might benefit stakeholders in a product's value chain. In so doing, we introduce the concept of the DPP and, then, describe the existing regime of regulated and voluntary product information tools focusing on the role of stakeholders. These initial results are reflected in an actor-centered analysis on potential advantages gained through the DPP. Data is generated through desk research and a stakeholder workshop. In particular, by having explored the role the DPP for different actors, we find substantial demand for further research on a variety of issues, for instance, on how to reduce red tape and increase incentives for manufacturers to deliver certain information and on how or through what data collection tool (e.g., database) relevant data can be compiled and how such data is provided to which stakeholder group. We call upon other researchers to close the research gaps explored in this paper also to provide better policy direction on the DPP. {\copyright} 2021 by the authors.

 abstract = {To facilitate the shift from a Linear to a Circular Economy, it is essential to alter the manner in which we manufacture, use, and dispose of products. Interoperable information exchange among various stakeholders throughout the product lifecycle is crucial if we wish to encourage reuse, repair, remanufacturing, refurbishing, or recycling. The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is a concept for capturing product information. This paper presents an end-to-end process for sharing product-related information along the product lifecycle explicitly designed to cater to the needs of all stakeholders, including end-of-life actors. This process is based on a DPP concept and implementation called the Digital Lifecycle Passport and a multi-stakeholder platform. Technically, it relies on the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), which enables information to be shared in a structured way. We demonstrate how this process can improve waste sorting and how it can be used for life cycle assessment (LCA). LCA results are captured in an interoperable way based on DIN SPEC 91474, which will facilitate automatic documentation for regulatory purposes in the future. Our approach is a forerunner in the sense that it uses the DPP and the AAS for end-of-life management. {\copyright} 2024 The Author(s).},

Such systems cannot reason about interventions and retrospection and, therefore, cannot serve as the basis for strong AI. To achieve human level intelligence, learning machines need the guidance of a model of reality, similar to the ones used in causal inference tasks. To demonstrate the essential role of such models, I will present a summary of seven tasks which are beyond reach of current machine learning systems and which have been accomplished using the tools of causal modeling.

@misc{Ompusunggu.2024,
 abstract = {Digital product passport (DPP) has been recently introduced by policymakers (e.g., the European Commission) to advance sustainable business practices towards a circular economy (CE). As a newly introduced concept, DPP is still relatively high-level and vague. Therefore, its definition, information flow architecture, what relevant information needs to be stored, and how to use such information in the context of a circular and sustainable manufacturing ecosystem, etc., are still open research questions. This paper addresses these research questions by proposing a novel conceptual framework for DPP, facilitating seamless information exchanges among CE stakeholders, and providing a transparent and trustworthy basis for decision-making. Causal AI utilisation is proposed to extract causal relationships among sustainability/circularity KPIs comprehensively, encompassing raw material supply chain, circularity-compliant product design, manufacturing optimisation on the shop floor, and after-sale product usage optimisation. Seamless information exchange will be achieved through semantic interoperability and a comprehensive model of the whole supply chain by employing an ontology model. The causal AI approach is proposed to identify causalities among KPIs and other factors to predict environmental impacts. This way, a causal model integrating domain expert knowledge and causality discovered from measured data will increase the transparency/explainability of prediction/decision made by machine learning algorithms.},

 abstract = {Digital Products Passports (DPPs) are digital documents accompanying individual product items and carrying data pertaining to product's life cycle; material and methods used in manufacturing, product distribution network, carbon footprint and environmental impact, context and time of use, and other. DPPs were first introduced in the EU Green Deal and are envisioned as a tool to facilitate the transition to a Circular Economy. Data stored and carried on DPPs will help inform policy making as well as consumer behavior. However, the wide scope of use cases and market sectors under consideration pose significant challenges in deriving a generic DPP system design. This makes difficult the development of corresponding standards, which in turn hinders market stakeholders from onboarding the use of DPPs. We address this problem by means of a DPP use case framework that captures the core underlying structure of DPP use cases that is common in its many application areas. We also present a technical architecture for DPP systems based on Distributed Ledger Technologies and Smart Contracts and provide the code for a working prototype. We conclude by discussing future extensions of this work, particularly with respect to evaluating the performance of our implementation.  {\copyright} 2023 IEEE.},

The works include an assessment of existing critical raw materials information management and an information needs identification survey, with 10 manufacturers, producer responsibility organisations, collectors and recyclers. The needs were used to generate 14 key product information management processes and exchanges that when implemented form a Digital Product Passport based circular supply management system. Information managed via a physical-digital linkage through individual product tags includes product registrations, materials declarations, life cycle status updates, the sorting of products at collection points based on critical raw material contents, and flagging of products for critical raw materials component extraction. A dataspace-based IT systems architecture is proposed for the implementation of the supply management system taking into account global and European information standards.

This study explores the use of digital product passports (DPPs) to improve how we manage products throughout their lifecycle. However, dealing with the complexity and large volume of data in DPPs can be challenging in terms of effective information management and utilization. We address this issue by adopting a modular ontological approach to systematically capture product lifecycle information from its origin to its end-of-life phase. To ensure interoperability and reusability of the ontology, we annotate key concepts and relationships using International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards that promote circular economy. Our research led to the development of several ontology modules derived from literature reviews and interviews conducted with industry and academia experts who specialize in sustainability. These modules were then integrated to create a digital product passport ontology. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using a modular ontology approach to manage the complex information inherent in DPPs paving the way for more sustainable management practices in the built environment sector. {\copyright} 2024 The Authors},

 abstract = {The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is a concept for collecting and sharing product-related information along the life cycle of a product. DPPs are currently the subject of intense discussion, and various development efforts are being undertaken. These are supported by regulatory activities, especially in the case of the battery passport. The aggregation of product life-cycle data and their respective use, as well as the sharing of these data between companies, entrepreneurs, and other actors in the value chain, is crucial for the creation of a resource-efficient circular economy. Despite the urgent need for such a solution, there is currently little attention given to the digital infrastructure for the creation and handling of the DPPs (i.e., the so-called DPP system). Moreover, there is so far no common understanding of what the requirements for a DPP system are. This is the background and underlying motivation of our paper: we identify the requirements for a DPP system in a structured way, i.e., based on stakeholder involvement and current literature from science and industry.

@proceedings{Pourjafarian.2023,
 abstract = {The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is a vital enabler of the circular economy. However, creating interoperability among digital representations of products/assets and preserving privacy are core challenges for a successful implementation of the DPP. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS), by offering a consistent metamodel and application programming interface, helps interested parties to communicate via such a standard digital representation. In this paper, we present our Cloud-based system, which enables multiple stakeholders to build their own AAS. With the help of a user interface, different stakeholders can interact with existing AASs and add their own information based on existing templates. In earlier work on the AAS, the manufacturing phase of a product was in the focus. To both leverage the full potential of the AAS and to make the circular economy work, however, it is crucial to take later lifecycle phases and their related stakeholders equally into account. Our work therefore strongly emphasizes a multi-stakeholder perspective on the AAS and hence, the DPP. We demonstrate how the DPP is beneficial for recycling an asset in a real-world use-case. Our solution also addresses concerns about data privacy by implementing role-based access authorization constraints. We also offer the capability to deploy third-party services within our Cloud-based infrastructure. {\copyright} 2023 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The primary aim of this study is to explore and understand the potential benefits and applications of the Digital Product Passport (DPP) system within the modern manufacturing industry. To achieve this, we developed a unique methodology, model, and a template for creating a DPP, identifying the key characteristics essential for effective implementation. Our approach involved an analysis of the literature and the formulation of a unified DPP framework, tailored to enhance supply chain transparency and support sustainable manufacturing practices. The empirical findings from our research demonstrate the DPP's impact on supply chain transparency, providing crucial product lifecycle information that bolsters decision-making and facilitates optimal resource management. Additionally, our study suggests that the DPP model, when applied to sectors such as electronics manufacturing, promises transformative results. This research underpins the pivotal role of DPPs in the future of manufacturing, highlighting their potential to catalyze a shift towards greater transparency and sustainability. Actionable guidelines are provided for manufacturers considering the adoption of this innovative system. {\copyright} 2024 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Digital Product Passport is a digital tool, that collects product related information across its lifecycle and value chain and allows accessing it by relevant actors. Although food has been currently excluded from the ongoing legislation efforts at EU level, there are many potential advantages related to digital product passports implementation in food sector: enhanced traceability resulting in increased confidence in terms of food safety, facilitated auditability, improved transparency along the supply chain, facilitation of informed decision making resulting in healthier and more environmentally friendly choices. Those are even of greater importance, when it comes to organic and geographic indication food assets, which are especially vulnerable to fraud and adulterations. The paper presents ongoing work on the conceptual development of dynamic Digital Product Passport for organic/geographic indication products, which is taking place in parallel with technical development within a mobile application. The main characteristics forming the basis of the implementation (dynamic updates, consultations with stakeholders, data content) are presented and analysed in the context of EU legislation and likely environmental and health benefits resulting from implementation of the tool for organic and geographic indication food assets. Challenges faced and approaches developed to overcome them are also discussed and next steps explained. {\copyright} The Authors,published by EDP Sciences.},

To do this, we consulted over 40 stakeholders and qualitatively analyzed six DPP use cases linked to specific circular economy actions in the three priority sectors (Battery, Electronics and Textile). The exploration of the DPP use cases in circular economy activities of the three sectors has revealed a compelling potential to address persistent data challenges. This report summarizes our main findings which highlight the ability of the DPP to reduce information asymmetry and foster trust in second-hand markets and life-extension applications, as well as to increase the recovery rate of valuable materials and products at end of their life (or use). These findings advocate for large-scale piloting of DPP use cases to further quantify the benefits and enrich the repository of use cases. Finally, we also identified barriers to the deployment of the DPP, which are summarized in the form of actionable recommendations.},

@article{Wan.2025,
 abstract = {Digital product passports (DPP) aim to provide comprehensive information on products throughout their lifecycle, improving decision-making in Circular Economy (CE) strategies. Although Eco-design for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) has outlined requirements for information, technical designs, and operation of DPPs, it does not specify the types of information required at each lifecycle stage or the solution components, which can impact DPP development. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic literature review and examined 25 DPP frameworks across different industries, focusing on four main areas: data carrier, data source, data security, and user access and verification. Findings show that QR codes and RFID tags are commonly used data carriers in the manufacturing and construction industries, and Blockchain technology is the most widely adopted solution for data security. Furthermore, we sorted the types, and suggested information stored in DPPs into four stages of the lifecycle. Our review highlights a lack of efforts to enable information updates during maintenance by third-party service providers in the product use phase after the DPP has been launched. In response, we propose a conceptual blockchain-based DPP framework that supports a dynamic information flow, allowing verified users (e.g., repairers) to update DPPs with necessary lifecycle information (e.g., maintenance details). Implications such as the security of data carrier and identifying critical data for DPP to avoid information overload need to be considered. Advancing DPP with artificial intelligence tools should be explored to predict and estimate the product health to enhance longevity.},

 abstract = {A blockchain is a distributed ledger for recording transactions, maintained by many nodes without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. All nodes validate the information to be appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in which entries are appended. Consensus protocols for tolerating Byzantine faults have received renewed attention because they also address blockchain systems. This work discusses the process of assessing and gaining confidence in the resilience of a consensus protocols exposed to faults and adversarial nodes. We advocate to follow the established practice in cryptography and computer security, relying on public reviews, detailed models, and formal proofs; the designers of several practical systems appear to be unaware of this. Moreover, we review the consensus protocols in some prominent permissioned blockchain platforms with respect to their fault models and resilience against attacks. The protocol comparison covers Hyperledger Fabric, Tendermint, Symbiont, R3{\~{}}Corda, Iroha, Kadena, Chain, Quorum, MultiChain, Sawtooth Lake, Ripple, Stellar, and IOTA.},

 abstract = {The manufacturing industry is increasingly focused on sustainability, requiring greater product transparency to meet sustainability targets. Digital Product Passports (DPPs) have emerged as a potential solution to improve recyclability and inform consumer purchasing decisions. However, there is a lack of methodology and digital representation for building DPPs, which hinders data linkage and sharing. In this paper, we propose an approach based on standardised data models and event sourcing to aggregate production data, using energy consumption as an example. We present a concept that captures and stores process information using event sourcing in Asset Administration Shells (AAS), and evaluate its feasibility through a manufacturing demonstrator. The results show that event-based aggregation facilitates the creation of DPPs, allowing different actors in the value chain to participate in an interoperable way. By leveraging a standardised and interoperable common data space, this approach improves product transparency, promotes recyclability and enables informed consumer choice in line with sustainability goals.  {\copyright} 2024 IEEE.},

@article{Androulaki.2018,
 abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).  Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain platforms that require {\textquotedbl}smart-contracts{\textquotedbl} to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.  This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

@misc{Barr.2024,
 abstract = {Service Mesh has become essential for modern cloud-native applications by abstracting communication between microservices and providing zero-trust security, observability, and advanced traffic control without requiring code changes. This allows developers to leverage new network capabilities and focus on application logic without managing network complexities. However, the additional layer can significantly impact system performance, latency, and resource consumption, posing challenges for cloud managers and operators.

In this work, we investigate the impact of the mTLS protocol - a common security and authentication mechanism - on application performance within service meshes. Recognizing that security is a primary motivation for deploying a service mesh, we evaluated the performance overhead introduced by leading service meshes: Istio, Istio Ambient, Linkerd, and Cilium. Our experiments were conducted by testing their performance in service-to-service communications within a Kubernetes cluster.

Our experiments reveal significant performance differences (in terms of latency and memory consumption) among the service meshes, rooting from the different architecture of the service mesh, sidecar versus sidecareless, and default extra features hidden in the mTLS implementation. Our results highlight the understanding of the service mesh architecture and its impact on performance.},

This study addresses the need for detailed product information on materials, origin, usage, and end-of-life instructions to improve recycling practices and promote sustainable consumption. The approach integrates decentralized identifier (DID) technology for unique product identification using the cheqd.io platform with an enterprise tailored Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network for DPP data management, leveraging their strengths to enhance security and efficiency. This paper details the data model for the DPP, including entities like Product, Manufacturer, Supplier, and Material. Performance tests on the Hyperledger Fabric network demonstrate the system's efficacy, focusing on CRUD operations and scalability. Future work will extend to the development of client applications and more comprehensive performance evaluations considering scalability and network expansion. {\copyright} 2024 by the authors.},

@misc{Garcia.2024,
 abstract = {Digital product passports (DPP) have been proposed in the European Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) as a means to keep and provide product information that facilitates product reusage, reparation, and recycling. Thus, DPPs should provide a positive effect on the environmental impact of future manufactured products, preventing waste and promoting a circular economy (CE) model. ESPR settles a set of requirements in collecting and administering product-related data. Decentralised identifiers (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) are two self-sovereign-identity-related elements that may help in that DPP management since they introduce a decentralised administration of identity that may enhance the overall scalability of the resulting system, improving also its reliability. This paper analyses the ESPR requirements and describes how they may be achieved using DIDs and VCs, assessing their performance in some scenarios.

The paper describes a type of non-discretionary access control - role-based access control (RBAC) - that is more central to the secure processing needs of non-military systems than DAC.
