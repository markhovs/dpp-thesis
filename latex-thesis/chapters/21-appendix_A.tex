The literature review was conducted following a structured methodology, as showcased in \Cref{fig:literature_review}, for comprehensive coverage of all relevant studies.

First, an extensive search was performed across multiple academic databases (see \Cref{tab:research_resources}), followed by de-duplication and an initial screening based on titles and abstracts. Articles that passed this screening underwent a full‐text review, ultimately yielding the final set of academic papers aligned with the research objectives.

To capture the breadth of research in the area of \acrlong{dpp}s and their broader ecosystem, both simple keywords and more complex Boolean/phrase combinations were utilized in the search process. \Cref{tab:literature_keyword_search} summarizes the high-level topic categories alongside the respective keyword sets. By incorporating operators such as AND, OR, and quotation marks for exact phrases, the search was optimized to include only the most relevant literature. All of the findings were then imported into Citavi reference management software to streamline organization, elimination, and citation of the reviewed literature. This structured, iterative approach ensured comprehensive coverage and yielded a robust pool of academic sources for the thesis.
